**5.)** B) The cookies created during the anonymous browsing session were deleted, no information exists in the browser to inform future visits to the same website. Thus, any shopping cart items will not be available for future purchase. If a user is working from a network, such as at work or at school, the administrator of that network can monitor all activity of a user, including information that is sent to the Internet.

**12.** A) An audio signal of the customer’s voice is needed when the customer describes the issue in the upgraded system. It is not needed in the original system. The customer’s keypad selection is used in the original system but not in the upgraded system. The customer’s phone number is captured in upgraded system; however, it is not needed to direct a call to the appropriate destination.

**13.** C) Weather patterns are not tracked in the metadata. (knowledge from data)

**16.** B) It is not possible to determine the number of movies purchased by an individual subscriber for a particular month. In this database, information about individual subscribers, such as their ID number, is not stored. The database can be filtered to identify the rows in which entries in the City column match a certain city. Those rows can be filtered to identify the rows that fall within a certain month. By summing the Number of Times Purchased values for the filtered rows, the total number of movies purchased in a certain city during a certain month can be calculated.

**23.** A) The aggregation of information in browser cookies can be used by websites that the user visits to track the user and collect information about the user. In public key encryption, a person or organization who wants to receive encrypted information via the Internet posts their public key for anyone to use. By its nature, this key is meant to be public and thus does not compromise personal privacy.

**24.** A) Each packet contains data to be transmitted, along with metadata containing information used for routing the data.

**28.** D) There are trade-offs involved in choosing a compression technique for storing and transmitting data. Once a data file is compressed, it can be restored to its original state.

**37.** D) Code does not end after establishing that the max is x. Once the rest of the code runs, it states that z is the max, which is false.

**39.** C) 80 seconds; when two processors are run in parallel, the two processors that take the most time will be run simultaneously. Since Z finishes first, Y then follows. Within that time, processor X will finish, and Y will finish after that. The total time will be 80 seconds.

**46.** D)  Protocols are agreed-upon sets of rules that specify the behavior of a system. Protocols used on the Internet enable devices from different manufacturers to communicate in a standard way. Routing on the Internet is usually dynamic; it is not specified in advance.

**49.** D) The actions of the ISP will only affect how frequently visited pages are loaded into Web browsers. Pages not saved by the ISP are still accessed as they were before. For many users who visit the same few Web pages often, average response time may decrease.

**50.** C)  If a negative of the original image is made, each RGB triplet value will be computed by subtracting the original value from 255. The original value can then be restored by subtracting the new value from 255. This process is lossless because the exact original can be restored. By copying pixels from one part of the image to another part of the image, the old RGB values of the pixels have been lost.
