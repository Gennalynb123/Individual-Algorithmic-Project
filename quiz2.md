**1.** D) Parallel computing solutions consist of a parallel portion and a sequential portion. When increasing the use of parallel computing in a solution, the efficiency of the solution is limited by the sequential portion. This means that at some point, adding parallel portions will no longer meaningfully increase efficiency. Eventually, adding parallel portions will no longer meaningfully increase efficiency.

**3.** C) The use of material created by someone else without permission raises ethical concerns and can have legal consequences. Using a Creative Commons license to publish a derived work does not free the musician from having to first obtain permission. Open-source software can be freely modified, and doing so does not in itself raise any legal or ethical concerns.

**8.** C) Open-source software has source code that is released under a license that allows users the rights to use and distribute it. However, there is no guarantee that the original developer of open-source software will provide support for its users. Open-source software can be continually updated without the original developers once it becomes available to the public.

**14.** A) The two line graphs are roughly the same shape. Each value on the right line graph is about 10 times the corresponding value on the left line graph. Therefore, the average amount of data stored per user is about 10 GB.

**16.** A) Basing the recommendation algorithm on data from a random sample of users will help ensure that the data gathered are more representative of all users of the application. Gathering data from a representative sample can help the developers avoid bias.

**22.** B) IPv6 allows for a greater number of IP addresses compared to IPv4, essentially allowing more devices to be connected to the Internet. It does not allow users to bypass security protocols or send data peer-to-peer.

**42.** B and C) Cloud computing has helped enhance collaboration but has introduced new data-security concerns. Cloud storage sites allow users to share files easily, which lead to increased concerns about copyrighted materials being illegally distributed online.

**45.** A) The desired information can be determined by using the student IDs in spreadsheet II to identify the students who play a sport. Once the students who play a sport are identified, the grade point averages of students who play sports in spreadsheet I can be compared to the grade point averages of all other students in spreadsheet I. The desired information cannot be determined with spreadsheets II and III because students with grade point averages of 3.5 or less cannot be identified.

**49.** C) Byte pair encoding is a lossless transformation because it can be restored to its original version
