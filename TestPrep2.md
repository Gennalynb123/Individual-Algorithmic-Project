### 5.3-5.4 Notes:

**5.3 Computing Bias**

Essential Knowledge:
* bias exists in computing innovations
* computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation
* programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases
* biases can be embedded at all levels of software development
* enhancing or intentionally excluding?
* intentionally harmful/hateful?
* receiving feedback from a wide variety of people?

**5.4 Crowdsourcing: Exploring the advantages of a computer's reach**

Essential Knowledge:
* people participate in problem-solving processes at scale
* widespread access to information and public data facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions, and dissemination of results
* science has been affected by using distributed and "citizen science" to solve scientific problems
* citizen science is scientific research conducted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scientists, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices
* crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining input or information from a large number of people via the internet
* human capabilities can be enhanced by collaboration via computing
* crowdsourcing offers new models for collaboration, such as connecting businesses or social causes with funding

## GitHub Actions:
### 5.3 - Computing Bias
1. No, I think that the owner of this computer did not think this was intentional.
2. I think that the man believed that
3. I think this happened through a lack of testing with different races and ethnicities, and through the development of the camera by a white man without a person of color in the development team.
4. Yes, this is harmful. However, I do not believe that it is meant or intended to be harmful or exclusive.
5. Yes, this should definitely be corrected.
6. In order to produce a better outcome, a development team must make sure their team is diverse with a wide set of perspectives, allowing for a lesser chance of bias in computing. Much more testing must also take place, and should be tested by people of different races, ethnicities, and backgrounds. I should also reach out to a wide variety of different people for suggestions and feedback on whatever project I am working on.

### 5.4 - Crowdsourcing
1. A crowdsource idea can be creating a google form and sending it in the general slack channel to allow all different types of students in the CSP community to put in their feedback and suggestions for whatever questions or ideas I put in the google form.
2. Del Norte crowdsourcing can be created in a similar way, allowing for an even wider selection of suggestions and perspectives. I could final my project with crowdsourcing by asking many people of different backgrounds to test my website and provide different suggestions and feedback.
