## 5.5 - 5.6 Notes/Github Actions

### 5.5 - Legal and Ethical Concerns
Essential Knowledge:
* the use of computing can raise legal and ethical concerns
* material created on a computer is the intellectual property of the creator or an organization
* ease of access and distribution of digitized information raises intellectual property concerns regarding ownership, value, and use
* measures should be taken to safeguard intellectual property
* use of material created by someone else without permission and presented as one's own is plagiarism and may have legal consequences
* some examples of legal ways to use materials created by someone else include:

- **creative commons**: a public license that enables the free distribution of an otherwise copyrighted work. This is used when the content creator wants to give others the right to share, use and build upon the work they have created.
- **open source**: programs are made freely available and may be redistributed and modified
- **open access**: online research output free of any and all restriction on access and free of many restrictions on use, such as copyright or license restrictions

* the use of material created by someone other than you should always be cited
* creative commons, open source, and open access have enabled broad access to digital information
* as with any technology or medium, using computing to harm individuals or groups of people raises legal and ethical concerns
* computing can play a role in social and political issues, which in turn often raises legal and ethical concerns
* digital divide raises ethical concerns around computing
* development of software allows access to digital media downloads and streaming
* the existence of computing devices that collect and analyze data by continuously monitoring activities

### 5.6 Safe Computing
Essential Knowledge:
* risks to privacy can occur from collecting and storing personal data on a computer
* personally identifiable information (PII) is information about an individual that identifies, links, relates, or describes them (includes age, race, phone numbers, medical info, financial info)
* search engines can record and maintain a history of searches made by users
* websites can record and maintain a history of individuals who have viewed their pages
* devices, websites, and networks can collect information about a user's location
* technology enables the collection, use and exploitation of information about, by, and for individuals, groups and institutions
* search engines can use search history to suggest websites or for targeted marketing
* disparate personal data, such as geolocation, cookies, and browsing history, can be aggregated to create knowledge about an individual
* PII and other information placed online can be used to enhance a user's online experiences
* PII stored online can be used to simplify making online purchases
* commercial and government curation of information may be exploited if privacy and other protections are ignored
* once information is placed online, it is difficult to delete
* programs can collect your location and record where you have been, how you got there, and how long you were at a given location
* information posted to social media services can be used by others; combining information posted on social media and other sources can be used to deduce private information about you
* explain how unauthorized access to computing resources is gained
* data sent over public networks can be intercepted, analyzed, and modified; one way that this can happen is through a rogue access point
* a rogue access point is a wireless access point that gives unauthorized access to secure networks
* a malicious link can be disguised on a web page or in an email message

### GitHub Actions:
**5.5**
1. The GitHub general public license is similar to the licenses noted above, because they both allow for open access of information provided in a repository, which includes information like code, plans, issues, and contributors' information.
2. I chose the open source MIT license because

**5.6**
1. A PII that I have seen on project in CompSci Principles is in the ReadMe where the contributors are listed. There, the name of the contributor and their github id is provided.
2. PII can be very helpful in certain situations. However, it can be very dangerous if it is open information provided to the public. My exposure for PII is mainly with social media, which is common for the younger generation.
3. Good passwords are several characters long, with a wide variety of characters. Bad passwords are very short, very guessable, or maybe very forgettable for the user to remember. Another step that is used to assist in authentication is a verification code sent to a user's phone number or email.
4. Symmetric encryption is a way for you to encrypt a message so that only you and an intended recipient can read it. It uses a secret key, the only key, that is used to both encrypt and decrypt electronic information. Asymmetric encryption is a process that uses a pair of related keys - one public and one private key - to encrypt and decrypt a message and protect if from an unauthorized access or use.
5. An example of encryption used in deployment is having the deployment manager input a key pair to deploy new code.
6. A phishing scheme I learned about was with viruses on certain websites. Phishing schemes occur when an attacker dupes a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message in order to steal personal information.
